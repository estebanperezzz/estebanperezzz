# ðŸš€ Ready to create something amazing together?  

Hi, Iâ€™m **Esteban PÃ©rez**, a 22-year-old tech enthusiast with over 4 years of experience in the tech world. ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ve worked in roles closely tied to software development, and Iâ€™m passionate about learning, experimenting with new tools, and tackling challenges in this ever-changing field.  

Right now, I work as both a **Product Manager/Scrum Master** and a **Software Engineer**. I plan projects, define goals, organize tasks, and help my team stay on track. At the same time, Iâ€™m hands-on with coding, building solutions that bring ideas to life.  

As a **Software Engineer**, I work with modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **tRPC**, and **AWS** to create scalable and efficient projects.  

I also have experience in **QA Automation**, writing test cases and automating processes using tools like Playwright and Katalon to ensure everything works perfectly. âœ…  

âœ¨ **Why work with me?**  
Because I bring not just technical skills, but also a passion for learning, creating, and delivering real results. Letâ€™s make your ideas happen!
